                <p class="details">John Bernthal | The Wolf of Wallstreet(2013)</p>
                <p class="description">
                    In this iconic scene from The Wolf of Wallstreet, John Bernthal is lifting weights in the back yard of his mother's house when he yells “Hey Ma, we got Chicken or what!” I like this scene because it is simple and I enjoy lifting weights. Good protein is hard to come by.

                    Because I like to laugh I have featured one of my favorite trends in memes, Shrek. Shrek has always been an iconic Ogre since I was a child; it has been nice growing up with him, he even has kids of his own now!

                <p class="description">
                     Because I grew up in Kentucky, I really enjoy the Cracker Barrel style of food. This image features a young couple who traveled to all 645 Cracker Barrels in America. Certainly, still in love, this is something simple I found sweet, maybe I’m just hungry.
